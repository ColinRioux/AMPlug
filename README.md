AMPlug
======
**Status:** Reinstated
You may visit the project site here: [http://colinrioux.github.io/AMPlug/]

======
Plug.dj had been shut down as of September 29 2015.
AMPlug was discontinued as of that date. 
Since Plug.dj's reopening this year, I have decided to actually fully update
this Plugin. 

## Getting Started
1. Create a new bookmark of this page, and put it on your favorites bar. 
2. Right click the bookmark and choose `Edit Address`
3. Delete the existing address, and paste: 
`javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://colinrioux.github.io/AMPlug/AMPlug.js');}());`

And from there, you're all set! 
Happy Plugging!
